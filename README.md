## 🚀 Project Overview

**Goal**:  
To predict if a patient requires hospitalization based on clinical indicators like age, oxygen level, body temperature, chronic diseases, and breathing issues.

**Why it matters**:  
Timely hospitalization can save lives, especially for patients with severe respiratory or chronic conditions. This tool can aid in triaging and prioritizing patients effectively.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following features:

| Column Name                  | Description                                     |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `age`                       | Age of the patient                              |
| `body_temperature`          | Body temperature in Celsius                     |
| `chronic_disease`           | 1 if patient has a chronic disease, else 0      |
| `breathing_issue`           | 1 if patient has difficulty breathing, else 0   |
| `Blood O2 Level in Percentage` | Oxygen saturation percentage (SpO2)         |
| `Needed Hospitalization`    | Target: 1 (Yes), 0 (No)                          |

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing

We applied several steps to prepare the dataset for modeling:

1. **📚 Library Importing**:
   - Essential libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

2. **🧼 Missing Value Imputation**:
   - Handled missing values using appropriate imputation methods.

3. **🔠 Encoding Categorical Data**:
   - Converted `chronic_disease` and `breathing_issue` if necessary using LabelEncoder.

4. **📤 Feature Split**:
   - Split dataset into features `X` and target variable `y`.

5. **📏 Feature Scaling**:
   - Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize numerical features.

## 🤖 Modeling and Evaluation

### Logistic Regression

- Used **Logistic Regression** as the classification algorithm.
- Predicts a probability of requiring hospitalization (0 or 1).

---

### 📉 Confusion Matrix

Used to assess model performance on true/false predictions:

|            | Predicted: No | Predicted: Yes |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Actual: No | True Negative  | False Positive |
| Actual: Yes| False Negative | True Positive  |

---

### 🚨 False Positives & False Negatives

- **False Negative**: Model predicts "No hospitalization", but patient **needs it** ➝ **Risky**.
- **False Positive**: Model predicts "Needs hospitalization", but patient **doesn't** ➝ **May waste resources**.

These were specifically monitored to avoid critical misjudgments.

### 🎯 Accuracy Paradox

- A model may have high accuracy by predicting the majority class.
- Evaluated using:
  - **Precision**: TP / (TP + FP)
  - **Recall**: TP / (TP + FN)
  - **F1-Score**: Balance between precision and recall.

### 📈 CAP Curve Analysis

- Shows how well our model distinguishes between hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases.
- Compared performance against:
  - **Random Model**
  - **Perfect Model**
  - **Our Model**
